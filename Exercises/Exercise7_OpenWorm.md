# Exploring Single Cell Simulated Physiology in Simulated Muscles

This file contains a set of tutorials hosted on [BadgeList](http://www.badgelist.com/) that were produced by volunteers in the [OpenWorm project](http://openworm.org) to walk you through understanding the math and computer code behind simulating cells with excitable membranes.

## Hodgkin Huxley Tutorial

This tutorial gives an introduction to the [Hodgkin-Huxley model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hodgkin%E2%80%93Huxley_model) by use of executable example implementations in Python and [NeuroML](http://www.neuroml.org). 

### The aims of this tutorial are:

1) Provide a guide to implementing the Hodgkin-Huxley model using both [Python](https://www.python.org/) and a [NeuroML2 implementation](http://journal.frontiersin.org/Journal/10.3389/fninf.2014.00079/abstract) of the same equations.
2) Give some background information on the electrophysiology underlying the Hodgkin-Huxley model.

## Muscle Model Builder

The muscle model project in the OpenWorm project (http://github.com/openworm/muscle_model) is open source code that contains multiple implementations of a published model of c. elegans muscle membrane dynamics.  

[Earning this badge](https://www.badgelist.com/OpenWorm/Muscle-Model-Builder) will show you the basics of how to download the code on your computer, install it, and run it.

## Muscle Model Explorer 

[Earning this badge](https://www.badgelist.com/OpenWorm/Muscle-Model-Explorer) will show you how to compare and interpret the output of the muscle model with figures in published papers.

## Muscle Model Hacker

[Earning this badge](https://www.badgelist.com/OpenWorm/Muscle-Model-Hacker) will show you how changes you make to the underlying model code changes the output of the model.
