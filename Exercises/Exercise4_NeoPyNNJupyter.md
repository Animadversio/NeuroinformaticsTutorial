 
## Demonstration of Neo/PyNN using Jupyter notebooks

This demonstration will illustrate the functionality of the multi simulator 
model specification format [PyNN](http://neuralensemble.org/PyNN/) and the data
storage API [Neo](http://neuralensemble.org/Neo/) through the use of browser based 
[Jupyter notebooks](http://jupyter.org/), as can be run on [Binder](http://mybinder.org/).
