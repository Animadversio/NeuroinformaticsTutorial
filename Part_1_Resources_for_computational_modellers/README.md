#### NeuroMorpho.Org

 NeuroMorpho.Org is a centrally curated inventory of digitally reconstructed neurons 
associated with peer-reviewed publications. It contains contributions from over 200 
laboratories worldwide and is continuously updated as new morphological reconstructions 
are collected, published, and shared. To date, NeuroMorpho.Org is the largest collection 
of publicly accessible 3D neuronal reconstructions and associated metadata.

#### Neuroelectro

The goal of the NeuroElectro Project is to extract information about the intrinsic 
electrophysiological properties of diverse neuron types from the neuroscience 
literature and place it into a centralized database for widespread comparison, 
reuse, and reanalysis.

#### Hippocampome.org

Hippocampome.org is a resource that combines approximately 21,000 pieces of experimental 
evidence about neuron types in the rodent hippocampus into a unified database. 
Analyzing these data has revealed about 10,500 different neuron properties and has 
identified over one hundred different neuron types.
