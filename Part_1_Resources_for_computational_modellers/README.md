# Part 1 - Resources for computational modellers

## 1.1 Experimental datasets

#### [Allen Cell Types Database](http://celltypes.brain-map.org/)

A multimodal database of single cell characterization to enable data-driven approaches 
to classification. Key features include: whole cell patch clamping, raw images and 
morphological reconstructions, a variety of abstract point models as well as 
biophysically detailed compartmental models, and single cell RNA sequencing data.
    
#### [Allen Brain Observatory](http://observatory.brain-map.org/visualcoding)

The Allen Brain Observatory is an in vivo survey of physiological activity in the 
mouse visual cortex, featuring representations of visually evoked calcium responses 
from GCaMP6-expressing neurons in selected cortical layers, visual areas and Cre lines. 

#### [CRCNS](http://crcns.org/)

A public repository hosting freely available neurophysiology and behavioural data 
useful for computational neuroscience.  Includes data from a variety of species 
and brain regions and species.

#### [NeuroMorpho.Org](http://neuromorpho.org/)

 NeuroMorpho.Org is a centrally curated inventory of digitally reconstructed neurons 
associated with peer-reviewed publications. It contains contributions from over 200 
laboratories worldwide and is continuously updated as new morphological reconstructions 
are collected, published, and shared. To date, NeuroMorpho.Org is the largest collection 
of publicly accessible 3D neuronal reconstructions and associated metadata. 


## 1.2 Structured data from literature 

#### Neuroelectro

#### [Hippocampome.org](http://hippocampome.org)

Hippocampome.org is a resource that combines approximately 21,000 pieces of experimental 
evidence about neuron types in the rodent hippocampus into a unified database. 
Analyzing these data has revealed about 10,500 different neuron properties and has 
identified over one hundred different neuron types.

#### [Nengo](http://nengo.github.io/)

Nengo is a graphical and scripting based software package for simulating large-scale 
spiking and non-spiking neural systems. It supports CPUs, GPUs (single and multi), 
MPI, and neuromorphic chips.

## 1.5 Model sharing

#### ModelDB

#### OSB

#### [NeuroML](http://www.neuroml.org)

NeuroML is a language for expressing models in computational neuroscience in a 
simulator independent, standardised format. It can express models from integrate 
and fire cells to complex networks of multicompartmental neurons.
